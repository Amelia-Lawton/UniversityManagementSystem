# UniversityManagementSystem
## Project Description
A University management system that allows you to:
- Search for Students:
Enter a search term (e.g., student name or student ID) in the search input field and click the "Search" button. The app should display the matching students' information along with their grades and attendance.
- Update Grades and Attendance:
For each student, you can update their grades and attendance by entering the updated data in the provided input fields under the "Update Grades" and "Update Attendance" sections. After entering the updated data, click the "Update" button to save the changes.
- View Updated Data:
After updating grades or attendance, the app should display the updated information for the student, including the new scores and averages.

## How to install and run
After cloning the repository and navigating to directory:
- install the project's dependencies. Run the command "npm install" to install the required dependencies listed in the package.json file
- Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the server. Run the command "npm app.js"
- This command will start the Express server, and you should see a message in the terminal indicating that the app is listening on a specific port 3000
Access the App in a Browser: http://localhost:3000
